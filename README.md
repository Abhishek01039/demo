# Flutter demo

Built with clean architecture and domain driven design with clear seperation of `Presentation`, `Domain` and `Data` layers.

âœ… Presentation layer: Contains

    ðŸ”† UI components like widgets and screens

    ðŸ”† BLoC: State management layer

    ðŸ”† View model

âœ… Domain layer: Contains

    ðŸ”† Data model / Data class to be used for the presentation layer

    ðŸ”† Mapper: Combines data from more than one data classes

    ðŸ”† Usecase: These use cases orchestrate the flow of data to and from the entities, and direct those entities to use their Critical Business Rules to achieve the goals of the use case.

    ðŸ”† Abstract repository

âœ… Data layer: Contains the implementation of repository which defines the data source (local or remote)

âœ… Data flows: From data layer to presentation layer

âœ… Call flows: Presentation layer to data layer
